## Abstract

Coral reefs in Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman waters of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) historically have been dominated by *Acropora* corals. By early 2021, however, extensive *Acropora* cover remained at only two UAE locations: the fringing reefs of Sir Bu Nair Island (SBN, Arabian Gulf) and Khor Fakkan (KF, Gulf of Oman).  

A summer 2021 heatwave impacted these last *Acropora* refugia and caused the first mass bleaching event on the UAE’s Gulf of Oman coast. Benthic surveys were conducted before, during, and eight months after this event.  

- **Bleaching severity:** 41% of hard corals bleached at KF, 93% at SBN  
- **Total live coral cover:** declined from 68% → 25% at KF; 36% → 9% at SBN  
- **Acropora cover:** declined from 23% → 2% at KF; 19% → 0.02% at SBN  
- **Recovery:** limited after eight months  
- **Community shift:** assemblages shifted away from *Acropora* toward heat-tolerant taxa (*Porites* and *Dipsastraea*), with increased homogenization  

These last *Acropora* refugia could have served as valuable larval sources for coral recovery elsewhere in UAE waters, highlighting the urgent need for conservation and restoration efforts.
